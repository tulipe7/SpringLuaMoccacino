This is a MockUpGenerator- it takes the Spring API, and trys to convert it into a working MockUp. 
Why not directly from source?
Cause ripping the type info from cPlusPlus functions poping them from the stack is no fun.
This implementation contains all functions callable by a spring game.
This does not simulate the engine, the returned value are just mockup Values.
There is also no checking of the handed over values for valid range.
Feel free to implement that.
